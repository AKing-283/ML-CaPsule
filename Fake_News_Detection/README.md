- Stemming
- Convert text to numerical data
- Splitting data into test and train
- Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate

# Included Gradio as User Interface
# How to use it:
-firstly run all the cells
-after running these cells at the last cell you will get a user interface
-In that interface submit your news in input section.
-The model will give you the output quickly with its confidence level
-if score is greater than 0.70 then that. news. is fake or else it is real. 

Here is the output of Gradio User Interface
