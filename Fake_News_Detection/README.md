# Fake News Detection in Python
This project is a Fake News Detection system using NLP and Logistic regression to make the prediction, on whether the news is fake or not. 

# Libraries used : 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- re
- nltk
- sklearn

# Steps being followed : 
- Import libraries
- Load the dataset
- Data Processing
- Stemming
- Convert text to numerical data
- Splitting data into test and train
- Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate


# Included Gradio as User Interface
# How to use it:
-firstly run all the cells.
-after running these cells at the last cell you will get a user interface
-In that interface submit your news in input section.
-The model will give you the output quickly with its confidence level
-if score is greater than 0.70 then that. news. is fake or else it is real.
